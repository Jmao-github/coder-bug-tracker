# Meeting Notes

## Open Questions
- How will user authentication be implemented in future iterations?
- Should we support file attachments for issues?
- What is the target deployment platform?

## Decisions & Rationales

### 2025-05-09T18:50:59.938-04:00 | Project Structure Setup
- **Decision**: Created `.cursorrules` and `.notes` structure based on project requirements
- **Rationale**: Following the No-Code Edition structure ensures consistent documentation and project management
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Using GitHub project boards: Rejected as it would split documentation across platforms
  - Using a separate wiki: Rejected for simplicity and closer integration with codebase

### 2025-05-09T18:50:59.938-04:00 | MCP Datetime Tool Integration
- **Decision**: Configured MCP Datetime tool for timestamp generation
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent, standardized timestamps for documentation without manual entry
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Manual timestamp entry: Rejected due to inconsistency and human error
  - Custom date function: Rejected as unnecessary when MCP tool is available

### 2025-05-09T19:18:53.214-04:00 | Profile Selector Implementation
- **Decision**: Created comprehensive prompt for adding zero-password profile selector and activity logging
- **Rationale**: Provides all necessary implementation details while maintaining existing UI patterns and data flow
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Using OAuth for authentication: Rejected as per non-goals (no formal auth required)
  - Implementing as separate microservice: Rejected for simplicity and to maintain the existing architecture

### 2025-05-09T20:51:16.401-04:00 | Metrics Cards Bug Fix
- **Decision**: Implemented a robust solution for metrics cards to accurately display issue counts after page refresh
- **Rationale**: Ensures reliable data display by using a dedicated state variable and multiple data sources
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Direct DOM manipulation: Rejected for poor maintainability and React anti-pattern
  - Relying solely on Supabase RLS: Rejected as it would complicate access control
  - Server-side rendering: Rejected as it would require significant architecture changes

### 2025-05-09T20:58:30.671-04:00 | Auth Category Display Bug Fix
- **Decision**: Fixed issue with Auth & Login issues not appearing in correct category list
- **Rationale**: Ensured category/segment consistency throughout the application for data integrity
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Custom mapping function: Rejected in favor of direct consistent naming
  - Additional database field: Rejected as unnecessary complexity
  - Client-side filtering: Rejected as less efficient than proper database queries

### 2025-05-09T21:04:15.319-04:00 | Category Filtering System Fix
- **Decision**: Standardized category filtering across all issue types while preserving working CodeGeneration behavior
- **Rationale**: Created consistent segment/category relationship model ensuring UI updates properly reflect database state
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Separate data models for each category: Rejected for unnecessary complexity
  - Client-side category arrays: Rejected for potential synchronization issues with database
  - Additional database fields for explicit category: Rejected for schema simplicity

### 2025-05-09T23:04:23.770-04:00 | Status Field Standardization
- **Decision**: Updated issue status field from 'pending' to 'in_progress' across the entire application
- **Rationale**: Creates consistent terminology and fixes UI display issues with "Unknown" status
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Keeping 'pending' and adding UI mapping: Rejected for clean data architecture
  - Creating status aliases: Rejected for unnecessary complexity
  - Client-side translation layer: Rejected as less reliable than database constraints

### 2025-05-09T23:04:23.770-04:00 | Status Cards Display Fix
- **Decision**: Implemented direct database count queries for status metrics to fix zero-value display issue
- **Rationale**: Ensures reliable status counts even after page refresh, applying the same pattern that fixed segment metrics
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Enhanced client-side counting: Rejected for same reasons as previous metrics issues
  - Using localStorage cache: Rejected for potential data staleness
  - WebSocket live updates: Rejected as unnecessarily complex for current needs
