- **Rationale**: Creates a flexible, extensible data model that handles both single messages and thread conversations while preserving all metadata
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Simplified flat schema: Rejected for inadequate relationship modeling and lack of future extensibility
  - Using separate tables for thread vs. single messages: Rejected for unnecessarily complex queries
  - Storing only minimal data fields: Rejected in favor of preserving all original data in raw_data fields

**Implementation Details:**
1. Created a unified schema that handles both thread messages and single messages with appropriate fields
2. Implemented mappings for all JSON fields from example messages to database columns
3. Created space identification system that maps chat_room_uuid to human-readable space names
4. Developed robust upsert functionality that handles duplicate message IDs
5. Implemented type normalization to consistently map message types to segments (auth, code, tool, misc)
6. Enhanced error handling for null fields and ambiguous column references

- **Decision**: Paused Phase A - DataPipeline implementation to address critical issues
- **Rationale**: Testing revealed data inconsistencies and schema conflicts preventing successful integration
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Continuing with partial implementation: Rejected as data integrity issues could cascade
  - Simplified schema version: Rejected as it wouldn't meet requirements for thread/reply handling
  - Client-side data transformation: Rejected as schema issues need to be resolved at database level

**Identified Issues:**
1. Schema inconsistency between database tables: Circle message data appears in multiple tables but schema has critical conflicts
2. Frontend display issues: Successfully imported data not appearing in frontend views
3. Database functions not correctly mapping Circle data to issue tracker format
4. Webhook data process completes but fails to properly transform and store data
5. Missing linkage between `circle_messages` and `issues` tables for proper data association
6. Deleted database migrations causing potential schema drift and function definition errors

**Next Steps (Pending):**
1. Reconcile schema conflicts between tables storing Circle data
2. Recreate deleted migrations to ensure proper database function definitions
3. Fix mapping logic between Circle messages and issue tracker format
4. Ensure proper data transformation in the `upsert_circle_message` function
5. Implement accurate frontend data fetching to display imported Circle messages
6. Create comprehensive test cases to verify full pipeline functionality

- **Rationale**: Ensures a lean, maintainable, and future-proof schema that supports all current product and integration needs without legacy bloat.
- **Implementation Summary**:
  1. Dropped all redundant/legacy tables and fields, including unused blobs and Circle message tables.
  2. Normalized Circle.so integration: all messages and replies are mapped to `circle_issues` and `circle_replies` (if present), with direct linkage to `issues`.
  3. Added/cleaned columns to match n8n webhook structure and frontend contract.
  4. Added parent_id to comments for threading, and removed unused fields from all tables.
  5. Optimized indexes and updated RLS policies for security and performance.
  6. Created and validated robust webhook processing and upsert logic for Circle.so payloads.

4. Simplified the Admin panel to focus solely on webhook functionality
5. Implemented better error handling and error display
6. Created detailed documentation in notes/webhook_processing_implementation.md
7. Simplified database schema by consolidating tables and removing duplicates
