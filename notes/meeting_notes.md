  - Implementing as separate microservice: Rejected for simplicity and to maintain the existing architecture

### 2025-05-09T20:51:16.401-04:00 | Metrics Cards Bug Fix
- **Decision**: Implemented a robust solution for metrics cards to accurately display issue counts after page refresh
- **Rationale**: Ensures reliable data display by using a dedicated state variable and multiple data sources
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Direct DOM manipulation: Rejected for poor maintainability and React anti-pattern
  - Relying solely on Supabase RLS: Rejected as it would complicate access control
  - Server-side rendering: Rejected as it would require significant architecture changes

### 2025-05-10T24:27:07.444-04:00 | Status Filter Toggle Fix
- **Decision**: Modified status filter behavior to lock selection and prevent toggling back to all issues
- **Rationale**: Improves UX by requiring an explicit "Clear Filter" action rather than inadvertent toggle-off
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Maintaining toggle behavior with visual indicator: Rejected for less intuitive interaction model
  - Dropdown-only filtering: Rejected for losing the benefits of direct status tile interaction

- **Rationale**: Eliminates UI redundancy and provides a more focused, clear interaction model
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Keeping both controls with synchronized state: Rejected for UI complexity and cognitive load
  - Moving dropdown to a different location: Rejected for unnecessary redundancy

- **Rationale**: Improves visual hierarchy and readability by creating clearer separation between UI sections
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Visual separator line: Rejected for adding unnecessary visual elements
  - Background color differentiation: Rejected for maintaining clean, minimal aesthetic
  - Card elevation changes: Rejected in favor of simpler spacing solution

### 2025-05-12T02:16:52.955-04:00 | Phase A - DataPipeline Implementation
- **Decision**: Implemented Phase A data pipeline requirements for Circle â†’ Supabase â†’ Dashboard integration
- **Rationale**: Created foundational structure to support automatic import of issues from Circle via n8n
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Direct API integration with Circle: Rejected as n8n provides better workflow automation capabilities
  - Webhook-based event-driven approach: Rejected as Circle doesn't provide webhook events for all needed data
  - Fully manual import process: Rejected in favor of automated pipeline with n8n

**Implementation Details:**
1. Created database schema for circle_issues table to store issues from Circle
2. Added issue_import_logs table to track import operations and maintain data provenance
3. Created SQL function for semantic categorization of issues based on content analysis
4. Built Admin panel with test data management functionality:
   - Delete all test issues (cascading to related records)
   - Mark existing issues as test data
5. Added Circle data sync UI for manual testing:
   - Form to create Circle issues and convert them to bug tracker issues
   - This simulates what n8n will do automatically 
6. Updated application to support the is_test flag for safely identifying test issues

**Next Steps:**
- Connect with the n8n instance once it's ready
- Implement scheduled job to periodically import new issues
- Add notification system for newly imported issues
